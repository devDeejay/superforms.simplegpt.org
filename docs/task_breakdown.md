## Super Forms: Task Breakdown

This document provides a detailed task breakdown for the Super Forms project, outlining the steps required to create a dynamic quiz application that generates beautiful and minimal quizzes based on a JSON input. Following this breakdown will help developers understand the priorities, scope, and workflow of the project.

### Task Breakdown

1. **Set up the project structure and version control**:
   - Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.
   - Create a well-organized directory structure for the codebase.
   - Set up branches for production, staging, alpha users, features, and bug fixes.

2. **Create the input screen**:
   - Design and implement a simple input screen with a text field for JSON input and a "CREATE" button.
   - Implement input validation and error handling for the JSON input.

3. **Parse JSON input and generate an internal data structure**:
   - Implement a function to parse the JSON input and generate a data structure representing the quiz questions and options.
   - Ensure that the data structure is flexible and can accommodate future updates to the quiz format.

4. **Design and implement the quiz UI**:
   - Develop a design for the quiz UI based on the specified design inspiration.
   - Implement the UI using a responsive and modular approach, making it easy to update and maintain.

5. **Display questions and handle user input based on question types**:
   - Implement functionality to display quiz questions one at a time.
   - Handle user input for different question types (e.g., text input, multiple-choice) and ensure that the user cannot skip any questions.

6. **Implement a results screen**:
   - Design and implement a results screen to display a summary of the user's answers in the specified JSON format.
   - Provide a way for users to review their answers and, if necessary, return to the quiz to make changes.

7. **Conduct thorough testing**:
   - Test the application extensively to ensure that it meets all functional and design requirements.
   - Identify and fix any bugs, performance issues, or usability problems.

8. **Optimize the application**:
   - Review the codebase and refactor it as needed to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
   - Optimize the application for responsiveness and performance on various devices and screen sizes.

By following this task breakdown, developers can work on the Super Forms project in a structured and organized manner, ensuring that the final application meets all design and functional requirements.

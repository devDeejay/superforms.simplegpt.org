## Design Requirements for Super Forms: Dynamic Quiz Application

The Super Forms project aims to create a dynamic quiz application with a clean, minimal, and visually appealing user interface. This document outlines the design requirements for the project, providing guidelines for developers to ensure consistency and coherence throughout the application.

### General Design Principles

- **Minimalism**: The quiz interface should be clean and clutter-free, focusing on presenting the questions and answer options in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.
- **Responsiveness**: The application should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices.
- **Accessibility**: The application should follow accessibility best practices, such as using appropriate color contrast, font sizes, and keyboard navigation support.

### Design Inspiration

The design of the quiz application should be inspired by the following Dribbble shot: https://dribbble.com/shots/21097494-Hellorep-ai-onboarding-experience

### Specific Design Requirements

1. **Input Screen**: The application should start with an input screen containing a text field for JSON input and a "CREATE" button. The text field should be large enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of JSON content, and the "CREATE" button should be prominently placed and easy to interact with.

2. **Quiz Interface**: The quiz interface should be full-screen and display one question at a time. Each question should be presented with a clear distinction between the question text and the answer options or input field. The design should be minimal, with a focus on the content and the user's interaction with the quiz.

   - For text input questions, provide a text field where users can enter their answer.
   - For multiple-choice questions, present the options as buttons or selectable elements, with clear visual feedback for the selected option.

3. **Question Navigation**: Users should not be able to skip questions. They must provide an answer before proceeding to the next question. You can implement this by disabling the navigation button or preventing the transition to the next question until a valid answer is provided.

4. **Results Screen**: After completing the quiz, the user should be presented with a results screen displaying a summary of their answers in the specified JSON format. The results screen should follow the same minimal design principles as the quiz interface, with a clear presentation of the JSON output and an option to restart the quiz or return to the input screen.

By adhering to these design requirements, developers can create a visually appealing and user-friendly quiz application that meets the goals of the Super Forms project.

## Super Forms: Dynamic Quiz Application

Welcome to the Super Forms project! This open-source project aims to create a dynamic quiz application that can generate beautiful and minimal quizzes based on a JSON input. The application will be built using a clean code architecture to ensure easy readability, maintainability, and expansion.

### Project Overview

The primary goal of Super Forms is to create a dynamic quiz application that takes a JSON input of questions and renders a full-screen, beautiful, and minimal quiz. The design should be inspired by this Dribbble shot: https://dribbble.com/shots/21097494-Hellorep-ai-onboarding-experience

The quiz will present one question at a time, with users required to answer each question before moving to the next. Once all questions are answered, the application will display a summary of the user's answers in a specified JSON format.

### Functional Requirements

1. Accept a JSON input of questions.
2. Generate a full-screen, minimal, and beautiful quiz.
3. Display questions one at a time, requiring user input for each.
4. Display a summary of the user's answers in JSON format after completing the quiz.

For more detailed information on the functional requirements, design guidelines, task breakdown, and clean code architecture guidelines, please refer to the [documentation](docs) folder.
